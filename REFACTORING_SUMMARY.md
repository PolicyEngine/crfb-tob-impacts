# Refactoring Summary: Improved Reproducibility

## What Was Done

### 1. **Code Organization**
- Created `src/` directory with modular Python code:
  - `src/reforms.py`: All 7 reform definitions in one reusable module
  - `src/impact_calculator.py`: Core calculation functions for fiscal and household impacts
  - Clear separation between data generation and presentation

### 2. **Reproducible Data Generation**
- Created `generate_policy_impacts.py`: Command-line script for generating all analysis data
  - Supports configurable year ranges
  - Outputs to standardized locations
  - Can skip household calculations for faster testing
- Added `generate_mock_data.py`: Mock data generator for testing when PolicyEngine is unavailable

### 3. **Testing Infrastructure**
- Comprehensive test suite in `tests/`:
  - `test_reforms.py`: Tests all reform definitions
  - `test_impact_calculator.py`: Tests calculation functions with mocking
  - 16 tests total, all passing

### 4. **Build Automation**
- Created `Makefile` with standard targets:
  - `make install`: Install all dependencies
  - `make data`: Generate policy impact data
  - `make book`: Build Jupyter Book documentation
  - `make test`: Run all tests
  - `make ci`: Full CI pipeline

### 5. **Dependencies Management**
- Added `requirements.txt` with all Python dependencies
- Clear specification of versions for reproducibility

### 6. **Fixed Directory Structure**
- Renamed `juypterbook/` to `jupyterbook/` (fixed typo)
- Updated all references in `.gitignore` and CI workflows

### 7. **CI/CD Updates**
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use new structure
- Added test execution to CI pipeline
- Temporarily using mock data generator due to PolicyEngine dependency issues

### 8. **Documentation**
- Created/Updated `CLAUDE.md` with project-specific guidance
- Added documentation about notebook relationships and data flow

## Current Status

✅ **Completed:**
- All code refactoring complete
- Tests written and passing locally
- Mock data generation working
- Jupyter Book builds successfully
- Changes pushed to PR #17

⚠️ **In Progress:**
- CI runs are executing (taking longer than expected)
- Two CI runs triggered:
  - Run 17871964914: Running for 8+ minutes
  - Run 17872013349: Pending (queued)

## Known Issues

1. **PolicyEngine Dependency Issue**:
   - NumPy 2.1.x compatibility issue with PolicyEngine
   - Workaround: Using mock data generator for CI

2. **CI Performance**:
   - CI runs taking longer than expected (8+ minutes)
   - May be due to queue or resource constraints

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Reproducibility**: Single command to regenerate all analysis
2. **Testability**: All core logic now has unit tests
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Reusability**: Reform definitions can be imported and reused
5. **Documentation**: Clear structure makes onboarding easier

## Next Steps

1. Monitor CI completion
2. Once PolicyEngine issues resolved, switch from mock to real data generation
3. Consider adding integration tests
4. Add performance benchmarks for data generation

## Commands for Future Development

```bash
# Install everything
make install

# Generate all data
make data

# Run tests
make test

# Build documentation
make book

# Full CI pipeline locally
make ci

# Clean all generated files
make clean
```
