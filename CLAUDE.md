# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Social Security taxation reform analysis project with two main components:
1. **Jupyter Book documentation** - Research report and analysis using MyST-NB (Jupyter Book 2.0)
2. **React dashboard** - Interactive policy impact visualization tool

## Build and Development Commands

### Setup with uv (Python 3.13)
```bash
# Install uv if needed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv --python 3.13
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
uv pip install -e .[dev]  # For development dependencies
```

### Jupyter Book Documentation
```bash
# Build the Jupyter Book (uses MyST-NB)
source .venv/bin/activate
cd jupyterbook
jupyter-book build .

# The built documentation will be in jupyterbook/_build/html/
```

### React Dashboard
```bash
# Navigate to the dashboard directory
cd policy-impact-dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server (runs on http://localhost:3000)
npm start

# Run tests
npm test

# Production build
npm run build
```

## High-Level Architecture

### Documentation Structure (Jupyter Book)
The Jupyter Book uses MyST-NB and contains:
- **intro.md** - Landing page and overview
- **policy-options.md** - Detailed policy proposals
- **prior-research.md** - Literature review
- **methodology.ipynb** - Technical analysis methods
- **policy-impacts.md** - Aggregate fiscal impacts
- **household-impacts.ipynb** - Distributional analysis with animated visualizations across years 2026-2035
- **bibliography.md** - References

Key configuration:
- `_config.yml` - MyST-NB configuration with forced notebook execution
- `_toc.yml` - Table of contents structure
- `hide_code_cells.py` - Custom script for hiding implementation details

### Dashboard Application
The React dashboard (`policy-impact-dashboard/`) provides interactive policy visualization:

**Core Components:**
- `PolicySelector` - Dropdown interface for policy selection with credit value options
- `ImpactDisplay` - Visualization of 10-year budgetary impacts
- `csvLoader` - Utility for loading and processing policy impact CSV data

**Data Flow:**
1. CSV data (`policy_impacts.csv`) contains pre-computed policy impacts
2. App loads CSV on mount and processes into policy options
3. User selects policy â†’ displays corresponding impact data
4. Supports policies with variable credit values (e.g., $100-$900 refundable credits)

### Data Integration
- Analysis notebooks generate `policy_impacts_results.csv` with fiscal estimates
- Dashboard consumes this CSV for visualization
- Both components share the same underlying PolicyEngine analysis
- Household impacts notebook generates multi-year data (2026-2035) with animated visualizations using Plotly animation frames

## Key Development Patterns

### Jupyter Book
- Uses MyST-NB (not legacy Jupyter Book 1.x)
- Notebooks execute on build with 600-second timeout
- Custom CSS in `_static/custom.css`
- Code cells can be toggled with show/hide prompts

### React Dashboard
- TypeScript with functional components
- No external state management (local state only)
- CSV parsing with PapaParse library
- Dynamic policy data based on CSV content

## Testing

### Dashboard Tests
```bash
cd policy-impact-dashboard
npm test          # Run all tests
npm test -- --coverage  # With coverage report
```

Tests use React Testing Library and focus on component rendering and data handling.
