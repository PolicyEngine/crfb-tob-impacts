FINAL ANSWER
============

Option 2 (85% taxation of SS benefits) - 2026:

WITHOUT LSR (Static):  $110.32B
WITH LSR (Dynamic):    $109.86B
LSR EFFECT:            +$0.24B (+0.2%)

TIER SEPARATION:
- OASDI (tier 1):      $0.00B (0%)
- Medicare HI (tier 2): $109.85B (100%)

Under Option 2, ALL trust fund revenue goes to Medicare HI
because thresholds at 0 put all taxable SS in tier 2.
