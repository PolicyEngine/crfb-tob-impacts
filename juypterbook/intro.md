# Social Security Taxation Reform: Policy Analysis and Impact Assessment

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines seven policy options for reforming the taxation of Social Security benefits, evaluating their 10-year budgetary impacts from 2026-2035 using microsimulation modeling. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) requested this analysis to inform policy discussions around Social Security solvency and tax reform.

Current law subjects Social Security benefits to income taxation under a two-tier system. Benefits become taxable when combined income, defined as the sum of an individualâ€™s adjusted gross income (AGI), nontaxable interest and half of their Social Security benefits, exceeds certain thresholds, with up to 50% of benefits taxable at lower income levels and up to 85% at higher income levels. The revenue generated from this taxation is allocated to the Social Security and Medicare Hospital Insurance trust funds.

## Policy Options Analyzed

This study examines seven distinct approaches to reforming Social Security benefit taxation:

- **Option 1 (Full Repeal)**: Complete elimination of Social Security benefit income taxation
- **Option 2 (85% Taxation)**: Taxation of 85% of all Social Security benefits regardless of income level
- **Option 3 (85% Taxation with Senior Deduction Extension)**: Combines 85% benefit taxation with permanent extension of the bonus senior deduction
- **Option 4 (Tax Credit System)**: Replaces the bonus senior deduction with a \$500 nonrefundable tax credit applied against Social Security taxation
- **Option 5 (Roth-Style Swap)**: Eliminates benefit taxation while making employer payroll contributions taxable to employees
- **Option 6 (Phased Roth-Style Swap)**: Gradual implementation of the Roth-style approach over multiple years
- **Option 7 (Eliminate Senior Deduction)**: Eliminates the additional standard deduction for seniors starting in 2026

## Background and Context

The taxation of Social Security benefits represents a significant component of federal revenue. This revenue stream directly supports the solvency of Social Security and Medicare trust funds, making reform considerations particularly complex from both fiscal and social policy perspectives.

The current system results in changes in effective marginal tax rates when income crosses taxation thresholds, sometimes referred to as "tax cliffs."

## Policy Environment

According to the 2023 Trustees Report, the combined OASI and DI trust funds are projected to become depleted in 2034. Reforms to benefit taxation affect both direct budgetary impacts and overall program finances.

This analysis provides quantitative estimates of both the budgetary impacts and household-level distributional effects of each reform option.

## Report Structure

This report is organized into six main sections:

1. **Policy Options**: Detailed descriptions of the seven reform scenarios analyzed
2. **Prior Research**: Review of existing analysis, particularly Congressional Budget Office estimates
3. **Methodology**: Description of our microsimulation modeling approach using PolicyEngine
4. **Policy Impacts**: Quantitative analysis of federal budgetary impacts for each option
5. **Household Impacts**: Distributional analysis showing how reforms affect different income groups and household types
6. **Comparison**: How our estimates compare to other analytical sources

## Scope and Limitations

This analysis focuses on federal budgetary impacts and household-level distributional effects. It does not evaluate:
- State-level tax implications
- Economic behavioral responses beyond those captured in the microsimulation model
- Administrative implementation challenges
- Political feasibility considerations

The estimates should be interpreted as projections based on current law baseline assumptions and may vary with changes in economic conditions or policy environment.
