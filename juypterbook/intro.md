# Social Security Taxation Reform: Policy Analysis and Impact Assessment

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines six policy options for reforming the taxation of Social Security benefits, evaluating their 10-year budgetary impacts from 2026-2035 using microsimulation modeling. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) requested this analysis to inform policy discussions around Social Security solvency and tax reform.

Current law subjects Social Security benefits to income taxation under a two-tier system. Benefits become taxable when combined income, defined as the sum of an individualâ€™s adjusted gross income (AGI), nontaxable interest and half of their Social Security benefits, exceeds certain thresholds, with up to 50% of benefits taxable at lower income levels and up to 85% at higher income levels. The revenue generated from this taxation is allocated to the Social Security and Medicare Hospital Insurance trust funds.

## Policy Options Analyzed

This study examines six distinct approaches to reforming Social Security benefit taxation:

- **Option 1 (Full Repeal)**: Complete elimination of Social Security benefit income taxation
- **Option 2 (85% Taxation)**: Taxation of 85% of all Social Security benefits regardless of income level
- **Option 3 (85% Taxation with Senior Deduction Extension)**: Combines 85% benefit taxation with permanent extension of the bonus senior deduction
- **Option 4 (Tax Credit System)**: Replaces the bonus senior deduction with a $500 nonrefundable tax credit applied against Social Security taxation
- **Option 5 (Roth-Style Swap)**: Eliminates benefit taxation while making employer payroll contributions taxable to employees
- **Option 6 (Phased Roth-Style Swap)**: Gradual implementation of the Roth-style approach over multiple years

## Background and Context

The taxation of Social Security benefits represents a significant component of federal revenue, generating approximately $48 billion annually as of 2023 {cite}`cbo2023`. This revenue stream directly supports the solvency of Social Security and Medicare trust funds, making reform considerations particularly complex from both fiscal and social policy perspectives.

The current system creates what economists term "tax cliffs" - sharp increases in effective marginal tax rates when income crosses taxation thresholds. These cliffs can create work disincentives and complicate retirement planning for beneficiaries.

## Policy Environment

Social Security faces long-term financing challenges, with the combined OASI and DI trust funds projected to become insolvent in 2034 according to the 2023 Trustees Report. Any reform to benefit taxation must be evaluated not only for its direct budgetary impact but also for its effects on overall program solvency and intergenerational equity.

The analysis presented here provides policymakers with quantitative estimates to inform discussions about potential reforms, while maintaining analytical neutrality regarding the merits of different approaches.

## Report Structure

This report is organized into five main sections:

1. **Policy Options**: Detailed descriptions of the six reform scenarios analyzed
2. **Prior Research**: Review of existing analysis, particularly Congressional Budget Office estimates
3. **Methodology**: Description of our microsimulation modeling approach using PolicyEngine
4. **Results**: Quantitative analysis of budgetary impacts for each option
5. **Comparison**: How our estimates compare to other analytical sources

## Scope and Limitations

This analysis focuses on federal budgetary impacts and does not evaluate:
- State-level tax implications
- Economic behavioral responses beyond those captured in the microsimulation model
- Distributional effects across different demographic groups
- Administrative implementation challenges
- Political feasibility considerations

The estimates should be interpreted as projections based on current law baseline assumptions and may vary with changes in economic conditions or policy environment.
