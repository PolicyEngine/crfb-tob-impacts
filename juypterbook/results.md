# Results

This chapter presents the quantitative results of our analysis of six Social Security benefit taxation reform options. All estimates represent changes in federal tax revenue over the 10-year period 2026-2035, measured in billions of dollars. Negative values indicate revenue losses (costs), while positive values indicate revenue gains (savings).

## Summary of 10-Year Budgetary Impacts

Our microsimulation analysis reveals significant variation in budgetary impacts across the six policy options:

| Policy Option | 10-Year Impact (Billions) |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Option 1**: Full Repeal | -$1,089.6 |
| **Option 2**: 85% Taxation | -$301.1 |
| **Option 3**: 85% with Senior Deduction | -$67.8 |
| **Option 4**: Tax Credit ($600) | -$94.3 |
| **Option 5**: Roth-Style Swap | -$727.8 |
| **Option 6**: Phased Roth-Style | -$1,166.2 |

## Detailed Results by Policy Option

### Option 1: Full Repeal of Social Security Benefits Taxation

**10-Year Impact: -$1,089.6 billion (revenue loss)**

This option eliminates all federal income taxation of Social Security benefits, representing the most expensive reform analyzed.

**Annual Progression:**
- 2026: -$81.0 billion
- 2027: -$86.2 billion  
- 2028: -$91.2 billion
- 2029: -$101.1 billion (senior deduction expires)
- 2030: -$107.3 billion
- 2035: -$137.0 billion

The cost increases over time due to:
- Growing number of Social Security beneficiaries
- Rising benefit levels with inflation adjustments
- Expiration of senior deduction in 2029 (no offsetting savings)

### Option 2: Taxation of 85% of Social Security Benefits

**10-Year Impact: -$301.1 billion (revenue loss)**

Contrary to initial expectations, this option generates less revenue than current law due to the interaction with the expiring senior deduction.

**Annual Progression:**
- 2026-2028: Approximately -$21.5 billion annually
- 2029-2035: Approximately -$31.0 billion annually

The pattern shows that expanding taxation to all beneficiaries at 85% does not fully offset the revenue loss from eliminating income thresholds, particularly given the current senior deduction structure.

### Option 3: 85% Taxation with Permanent Senior Deduction Extension

**10-Year Impact: -$67.8 billion (revenue loss)**

This option produces the smallest revenue loss among all options analyzed, as the permanent senior deduction significantly reduces the tax burden on affected beneficiaries.

**Annual Progression:**
- 2026-2028: Approximately -$21.7 billion annually (similar to Option 2)
- 2029-2035: Minimal impact (approximately -$0.5 billion annually)

The dramatic improvement after 2028 reflects the interaction between expanded benefit taxation and the permanent senior deduction, which substantially reduces tax liability for older taxpayers.

### Option 4: Social Security Tax Credit System ($600 Credit)

**10-Year Impact: -$94.3 billion (revenue loss)**

The $600 tax credit approach provides targeted relief to Social Security beneficiaries while expanding the taxation base to 85% of all benefits.

**Annual Progression:**
- 2026-2028: Approximately -$25.3 billion annually
- 2029-2035: Approximately -$3.2 billion annually

The improvement after 2028 reflects the interaction between the new credit system and the expiration of the senior deduction, as the credit provides an alternative form of tax relief.

### Option 5: Roth-Style Swap

**10-Year Impact: -$727.8 billion (revenue loss)**

Replacing benefit taxation with employer payroll contribution taxation produces significant revenue loss, indicating that current benefit taxation generates more revenue than would be collected from taxing employer contributions.

**Annual Progression:**
- 2026: -$60.5 billion
- 2030: -$73.3 billion
- 2035: -$95.7 billion

The increasing cost over time reflects the growing gap between benefit taxation revenue (which grows with an aging population) and employer contribution taxation revenue (which grows more slowly with the working population).

### Option 6: Phased Roth-Style Swap

**10-Year Impact: -$1,166.2 billion (revenue loss)**

The phased implementation produces the largest revenue loss among all options, as it combines:
- Gradual loss of benefit taxation revenue (higher revenue source)
- Gradual gain of employer contribution taxation (lower revenue source)
- Extended transition period that delays full implementation

**Annual Progression:**
- 2026: -$18.5 billion (small initial impact)
- 2030: -$100.6 billion 
- 2033: -$165.3 billion (peak impact)
- 2035: -$164.4 billion (stabilizes as phase-in completes)

## Key Analytical Findings

### Revenue Generation Hierarchy

From highest to lowest revenue generation:
1. **Option 3**: -$67.8 billion
2. **Option 4**: -$94.3 billion
3. **Option 2**: -$301.1 billion
4. **Option 5**: -$727.8 billion
5. **Option 1**: -$1,089.6 billion
6. **Option 6**: -$1,166.2 billion

### Impact of Senior Deduction Expiration

The scheduled 2028 expiration of the senior deduction creates notable inflection points in several options:

- **Options 1, 5, 6**: Costs accelerate after 2028 as taxpayers lose deduction relief
- **Option 2**: Revenue loss increases substantially after 2028
- **Option 3**: Minimal impact after 2028 due to permanent extension
- **Option 4**: Credit provides alternative relief mechanism

### Policy Design Insights

1. **Tax Credit Relief**: The $600 tax credit approach provides meaningful tax relief while maintaining revenue from expanded benefit taxation.

2. **Roth-Style Trade-off**: Current benefit taxation generates significantly more revenue than would be raised by taxing employer payroll contributions, making this swap costly.

3. **Phase-in Costs**: Gradual implementation (Option 6) increases transition costs compared to immediate implementation (Option 5).

4. **Senior Deduction Value**: The permanent senior deduction extension (Option 3) provides substantial tax relief, nearly offsetting expanded benefit taxation.

## Distributional Considerations

While this analysis focuses on aggregate budgetary impacts, the results suggest different distributional effects:

- **Option 1**: Benefits all current Social Security recipients
- **Options 2 & 3**: Increases taxes for lower-income beneficiaries currently below thresholds
- **Option 4**: Provides targeted relief to Social Security recipients
- **Options 5 & 6**: Shifts tax burden from retirees to current workers

## Confidence and Validation

These estimates are based on static microsimulation analysis and do not account for:
- Behavioral responses to tax changes
- Economic growth effects
- Administrative implementation costs
- State tax interactions

The results align with expected patterns from prior research and provide a comprehensive foundation for policy evaluation. The next chapter compares these findings to estimates from other analytical sources.
