# Policy Impacts

This chapter presents the quantitative results of the analysis of six Social Security benefit taxation reform options. All estimates represent changes in federal tax revenue over the 10-year period 2026-2035, measured in billions of dollars. Negative values indicate revenue decreases, while positive values indicate revenue increases.

## Summary of 10-Year Budgetary Impacts

The microsimulation analysis shows the following budgetary impacts across the six policy options:

| Policy Option | 10-Year Impact (Billions) |
|---|---|
| **Option 1**: Full Repeal | $1149.0 |
| **Option 2**: 85% Taxation | $-219.3 |
| **Option 3**: 85% with Senior Deduction | $-27.9 |
| **Option 4**: Tax Credit ($500) | $-86.8 |
| **Option 5**: Roth-Style Swap | $-756.2 |
| **Option 6**: Phased Roth-Style | $-1123.5 |


## Year-by-Year Federal Budgetary Impact (2026-2035)

| 2026 | $86.3 | $-18.3 | $-18.3 | $-24.4 | $-58.2 | $-18.7 |
| 2027 | $91.8 | $-18.3 | $-18.3 | $-24.6 | $-61.4 | $-39.9 |
| 2028 | $96.9 | $-18.1 | $-18.1 | $-24.6 | $-65.6 | $-63.7 |

## Detailed Results by Policy Option

### Option 1: Full Repeal of Social Security Benefits Taxation

**10-Year Impact: $1149.0 billion**

This option eliminates all federal income taxation of Social Security benefits. The revenue impact changes over time due to:
- Changes in the number of Social Security beneficiaries
- Changes in benefit levels
- Expiration of senior deduction in 2029

### Option 2: Taxation of 85% of Social Security Benefits

**10-Year Impact: -$219.3 billion**

This option taxes 85% of Social Security benefits for all recipients. The results show that expanding taxation to all beneficiaries at 85% does not offset the revenue change from eliminating income thresholds under the current senior deduction structure.

### Option 3: 85% Taxation with Permanent Senior Deduction Extension

**10-Year Impact: -$27.9 billion**

This option taxes 85% of Social Security benefits while permanently extending the senior deduction. The change after 2028 reflects the interaction between expanded benefit taxation and the permanent senior deduction.

### Option 4: Social Security Tax Credit System ($500 Credit)

**10-Year Impact: -$86.8 billion**

This option implements a $500 tax credit while expanding the taxation base to 85% of all benefits. The change after 2028 reflects the interaction between the credit system and the expiration of the senior deduction.

### Option 5: Roth-Style Swap

**10-Year Impact: -$756.2 billion**

This option replaces benefit taxation with employer payroll contribution taxation. The revenue impact changes over time as the difference between benefit taxation revenue and employer contribution taxation revenue evolves.

### Option 6: Phased Roth-Style Swap

**10-Year Impact: -$1123.5 billion**

This option implements a phased transition that includes:
- Gradual reduction of benefit taxation revenue
- Gradual increase of employer contribution taxation
- Extended transition period

## Key Findings

### Revenue Impact Ranking

From smallest to largest absolute revenue impact:
1. **Option 3**: -$27.9 billion
2. **Option 4**: -$86.8 billion
3. **Option 2**: -$219.3 billion
4. **Option 5**: -$756.2 billion
5. **Option 1**: $1149.0 billion
6. **Option 6**: -$1123.5 billion

### Impact of Senior Deduction Expiration

The scheduled 2028 expiration of the senior deduction affects the revenue patterns of several options:

- **Options 1, 5, 6**: Revenue impacts change after 2028
- **Option 2**: Revenue pattern changes after 2028
- **Option 3**: Different pattern due to permanent extension
- **Option 4**: Credit interacts with deduction expiration

### Policy Design Observations

1. **Tax Credit**: The $500 tax credit option combines a credit with expanded benefit taxation.

2. **Roth-Style Swap**: The analysis shows different revenue impacts between benefit taxation and employer payroll contribution taxation.

3. **Phase-in Effects**: Gradual implementation (Option 6) produces different revenue patterns than immediate implementation (Option 5).

4. **Senior Deduction**: The permanent senior deduction extension (Option 3) affects the net revenue impact of expanded benefit taxation.

## Distributional Considerations

The analysis focuses on aggregate budgetary impacts. The distributional effects vary by option:

- **Option 1**: Affects all current Social Security recipients
- **Options 2 & 3**: Changes tax treatment for beneficiaries currently below thresholds
- **Option 4**: Implements a credit for Social Security recipients
- **Options 5 & 6**: Changes the tax treatment between retirees and current workers

## Methodology Notes

These estimates are based on static microsimulation analysis and do not account for:
- Behavioral responses to tax changes
- Economic growth effects
- Administrative implementation costs
- State tax interactions

The results are presented for comparison with estimates from other analytical sources in the next chapter.
