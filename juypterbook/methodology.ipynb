    "\n",
    "This chapter describes our analytical approach for estimating the budgetary impacts of Social Security benefit taxation reforms. We employ microsimulation modeling using PolicyEngine, an open-source platform that provides detailed estimates of policy changes on federal tax revenue and household-level impacts.\n",

    "\n",
    "### PolicyEngine Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis uses PolicyEngine US, an open-source tax-benefit microsimulation model. PolicyEngine provides several advantages for this analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Tax Code Implementation**: Complete modeling of federal income tax provisions, including Social Security benefit taxation rules\n",
    "- **Current Data**: Based on the most recent enhanced Current Population Survey data (2024)\n",
    "- **Policy Flexibility**: Allows detailed specification of complex policy reforms\n",
    "- **Transparency**: Open-source codebase enables verification and replication\n",
    "- **Validation**: Regular benchmarking against official government estimates"

    "This chapter presents the quantitative results of the analysis of seven Social Security benefit taxation reform options. All estimates represent changes in federal tax revenue over the 10-year period 2026-2035, measured in billions of dollars. Positive values indicate costs (deficit increasing), while negative values indicate revenue increases (deficit reducing).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of 10-Year Budgetary Impacts\n",
    "\n",
    "The microsimulation analysis shows the following budgetary impacts across the seven policy options:\n",
    "\n",
    "{summary_table}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Year-by-Year Federal Budgetary Impact (2026-2035)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Federal Budgetary Impact by Year (Billions of Dollars)**\n",
    "\n",
    "{yearly_table}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Results by Policy Option\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Full Repeal of Social Security Benefits Taxation\n",
    "\n",
    "**10-Year Impact: {format_impact(totals['Option 1'])}**\n",
    "\n",
    "This option eliminates all federal income taxation of Social Security benefits. The revenue impact changes over time due to:\n",
    "- Changes in the number of Social Security beneficiaries\n",
    "- Changes in benefit levels\n",
    "- Expiration of senior deduction in 2029\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Taxation of 85% of Social Security Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "**10-Year Impact: {format_impact(totals['Option 2'])}**\n",
    "\n",
    "This option taxes 85% of Social Security benefits for all recipients. The results show that expanding taxation to all beneficiaries at 85% does not offset the revenue change from eliminating income thresholds under the current senior deduction structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3: 85% Taxation with Permanent Senior Deduction Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "**10-Year Impact: {format_impact(totals['Option 3'])}**\n",
    "\n",
    "This option taxes 85% of Social Security benefits while permanently extending the senior deduction. The change after 2028 reflects the interaction between expanded benefit taxation and the permanent senior deduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 4: Social Security Tax Credit System (\\\\$500 Credit)\n",
    "\n",
    "**10-Year Impact: {format_impact(totals['Option 4'])}**\n",
    "\n",
    "This option implements a \\\\$500 tax credit while expanding the taxation base to 85% of all benefits. The change after 2028 reflects the interaction between the credit system and the expiration of the senior deduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 5: Roth-Style Swap\n",
    "\n",
    "**10-Year Impact: {format_impact(totals['Option 5'])}**\n",
    "\n",
    "This option replaces benefit taxation with employer payroll contribution taxation. The revenue impact changes over time as the difference between benefit taxation revenue and employer contribution taxation revenue evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 6: Phased Roth-Style Swap\n",
    "\n",
    "**10-Year Impact: {format_impact(totals['Option 6'])}**\n",
    "\n",
    "This option implements a phased transition that includes:\n",
    "- Gradual reduction of benefit taxation revenue\n",
    "- Gradual increase of employer contribution taxation\n",
    "- Extended transition period\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 7: Eliminate Bonus Senior Deduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**10-Year Impact: {format_impact(totals['Option 7'])}**\n",
    "\n",
    "This option eliminates the \\\\$6,000 bonus senior deduction from the One Big Beautiful Bill starting in 2026. The revenue increase reflects:\n",
    "- Elimination of the deduction for eligible taxpayers aged 65 and older\n",
    "- Phase-out effects for higher-income taxpayers (6% phase-out starting at \\\\$75k single/\\\\$150k joint)\n",
    "- Impact limited to 2026-2028 as the deduction expires in 2029 under current law\n",
    "- Revenue pattern shows impact only in years when the deduction would have been available\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Revenue Impact Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "From smallest to largest absolute revenue impact:\n",
    "1. **Option 3**: {format_impact(totals['Option 3'])}\n",
    "2. **Option 4**: {format_impact(totals['Option 4'])}\n",
    "3. **Option 7**: {format_impact(totals['Option 7'])}\n",
    "4. **Option 2**: {format_impact(totals['Option 2'])}\n",
    "5. **Option 5**: {format_impact(totals['Option 5'])}\n",
    "6. **Option 1**: {format_impact(totals['Option 1'])}\n",
    "7. **Option 6**: {format_impact(totals['Option 6'])}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact of Senior Deduction Expiration\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduled 2028 expiration of the bonus senior deduction affects the revenue patterns of several options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Options 1, 5, 6**: Revenue impacts change after 2028\n",
    "- **Option 2**: Revenue pattern changes after 2028\n",
    "- **Option 3**: Different pattern due to permanent extension\n",
    "- **Option 4**: Credit interacts with deduction expiration\n",
    "- **Option 7**: Only has impact 2026-2028 since deduction expires in 2029\n",
    "\n",
    "### Policy Design Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tax Credit**: The \\\\$500 tax credit option combines a credit with expanded benefit taxation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Roth-Style Swap**: The analysis shows different revenue impacts between benefit taxation and employer payroll contribution taxation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Phase-in Effects**: Gradual implementation (Option 6) produces different revenue patterns than immediate implementation (Option 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Senior Deduction**: The permanent senior deduction extension (Option 3) affects the net revenue impact of expanded benefit taxation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bonus Deduction Elimination**: Option 7 provides revenue only during the years the deduction would have been in effect (2026-2028).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distributional Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis focuses on aggregate budgetary impacts. The distributional effects vary by option:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 1**: Affects all current Social Security recipients\n",
    "- **Options 2 & 3**: Changes tax treatment for beneficiaries currently below thresholds\n",
    "- **Option 4**: Implements a credit for Social Security recipients\n",
    "- **Options 5 & 6**: Changes the tax treatment between retirees and current workers\n",
    "- **Option 7**: Affects elderly taxpayers eligible for the bonus senior deduction, with phase-out for higher incomes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "These estimates are based on static microsimulation analysis and do not account for:\n",
    "- Behavioral responses to tax changes\n",
    "- Economic growth effects\n",
    "- Administrative implementation costs\n",
    "- State tax interactions\n",
