The analysis uses the latest stable release with Python 3.10+ and standard data processing libraries.\n\n## Methodology Notes and Limitations\n\n### Static Analysis Assumptions\nThis analysis uses static microsimulation without modeling behavioral responses, labor supply changes, or economic growth effects. We assume full compliance with new tax provisions, no administrative costs, and current law economic assumptions for inflation and wage growth.\n\n### Key Limitations\n- Survey data may underrepresent very high-income households and some income sources may be underreported\n- No interaction with state tax systems is modeled\n- Sample size limits precision for small subgroups\n- No macroeconomic feedback effects from policy changes are captured"

All estimates represent changes in federal tax revenue over the 10-year period 2026-2035, measured in billions of dollars. Negative values indicate revenue decreases, while positive values indicate revenue increases.\n\n## Summary of 10-Year Budgetary Impacts\n\nThe microsimulation analysis shows the following budgetary impacts across the six policy options:\n\n{summary_table}\n\n## Year-by-Year Federal Budgetary Impact (2026-2035)\n\n**Federal Budgetary Impact by Year (Billions of Dollars)**\n\n{yearly_table}\n\n## Detailed Results by Policy Option\n\n### Option 1: Full Repeal of Social Security Benefits Taxation\n\n**10-Year Impact: {format_impact(totals['Option 1'])}**\n\nThis option eliminates all federal income taxation of Social Security benefits. The revenue impact changes over time due to:\n- Changes in the number of Social Security beneficiaries\n- Changes in benefit levels\n- Expiration of senior deduction in 2029\n\n### Option 2: Taxation of 85% of Social Security Benefits\n\n**10-Year Impact: {format_impact(totals['Option 2'])}**\n\nThis option taxes 85% of Social Security benefits for all recipients. The results show that expanding taxation to all beneficiaries at 85% does not offset the revenue change from eliminating income thresholds under the current senior deduction structure.\n\n### Option 3: 85% Taxation with Permanent Senior Deduction Extension\n\n**10-Year Impact: {format_impact(totals['Option 3'])}**\n\nThis option taxes 85% of Social Security benefits while permanently extending the senior deduction. The change after 2028 reflects the interaction between expanded benefit taxation and the permanent senior deduction.\n\n### Option 4: Social Security Tax Credit System (\\\\$500 Credit)\n\n**10-Year Impact: {format_impact(totals['Option 4'])}**\n\nThis option implements a \\\\$500 tax credit while expanding the taxation base to 85% of all benefits. The change after 2028 reflects the interaction between the credit system and the expiration of the senior deduction.\n\n### Option 5: Roth-Style Swap\n\n**10-Year Impact: {format_impact(totals['Option 5'])}**\n\nThis option replaces benefit taxation with employer payroll contribution taxation. The revenue impact changes over time as the difference between benefit taxation revenue and employer contribution taxation revenue evolves.\n\n### Option 6: Phased Roth-Style Swap\n\n**10-Year Impact: {format_impact(totals['Option 6'])}**\n\nThis option implements a phased transition that includes:\n- Gradual reduction of benefit taxation revenue\n- Gradual increase of employer contribution taxation\n- Extended transition period\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Revenue Impact Ranking\n\nFrom smallest to largest absolute revenue impact:\n1. **Option 3**: {format_impact(totals['Option 3'])}\n2. **Option 4**: {format_impact(totals['Option 4'])}\n3. **Option 2**: {format_impact(totals['Option 2'])}\n4. **Option 5**: {format_impact(totals['Option 5'])}\n5. **Option 1**: {format_impact(totals['Option 1'])}\n6. **Option 6**: {format_impact(totals['Option 6'])}\n\n### Impact of Senior Deduction Expiration\n\nThe scheduled 2028 expiration of the senior deduction affects the revenue patterns of several options:\n\n- **Options 1, 5, 6**: Revenue impacts change after 2028\n- **Option 2**: Revenue pattern changes after 2028\n- **Option 3**: Different pattern due to permanent extension\n- **Option 4**: Credit interacts with deduction expiration\n\n### Policy Design Observations\n\n1. **Tax Credit**: The \\\\$500 tax credit option combines a credit with expanded benefit taxation.\n\n2. **Roth-Style Swap**: The analysis shows different revenue impacts between benefit taxation and employer payroll contribution taxation.\n\n3. **Phase-in Effects**: Gradual implementation (Option 6) produces different revenue patterns than immediate implementation (Option 5).\n\n4. **Senior Deduction**: The permanent senior deduction extension (Option 3) affects the net revenue impact of expanded benefit taxation.\n\n## Distributional Considerations\n\nThe analysis focuses on aggregate budgetary impacts. The distributional effects vary by option:\n\n- **Option 1**: Affects all current Social Security recipients\n- **Options 2 & 3**: Changes tax treatment for beneficiaries currently below thresholds\n- **Option 4**: Implements a credit for Social Security recipients\n- **Options 5 & 6**: Changes the tax treatment between retirees and current workers\n\n## Methodology Notes\n\nThese estimates are based on static microsimulation analysis and do not account for:\n- Behavioral responses to tax changes\n- Economic growth effects\n- Administrative implementation costs\n- State tax interactions\n\nThe results are presented for comparison with estimates from other analytical sources in the next chapter.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Write to file\n    with open('policy_impacts.md', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(content)\n    \n    print(\"Results successfully written to policy_impacts.md\")\n    return content\n\n# Execute the function to write results\nmarkdown_content = write_results_to_markdown()"
