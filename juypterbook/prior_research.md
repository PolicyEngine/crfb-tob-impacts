# Prior Research and Analysis

This chapter examines how major analytical organizations have estimated the budgetary impacts of Social Security benefit taxation reforms, with particular focus on full repeal and full taxation options. We present specific estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), and Tax Foundation to provide context for our analysis.

## Full Repeal of Social Security Benefit Taxation (Option 1)

Several organizations have analyzed the budgetary impact of completely eliminating the taxation of Social Security benefits. These estimates vary based on methodology, data sources, and projection periods.

**Important Note:** These estimates were produced before the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which includes a temporary \$6,000 bonus senior deduction (2025-2028). This new deduction reduces the baseline revenue from Social Security benefit taxation, which affects the cost estimates of full repeal.

### Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget Analysis (July 2024)

CRFB analyzed the proposal to end taxation of Social Security benefits using estimates from both CBO and the Social Security Trustees {cite}`crfb2024trump`.

#### CBO-Based Estimates

| Estimate | Impact |
|----------|---------|
| 10-Year Revenue Loss (2025-2034) | \$1.6 trillion |

#### Social Security Trustees-Based Estimates

| Estimate | Impact |
|----------|---------|
| 10-Year Revenue Loss (2025-2034) | \$1.8 trillion |

**Note:** These estimates were produced before the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which includes a temporary senior deduction that affects the baseline.

### Tax Foundation Analysis (August 2024)

The Tax Foundation analyzed Trump's proposal to eliminate Social Security benefit taxation {cite}`taxfoundation2024trump`. While specific revenue estimates were not provided in their published analysis, they characterized the proposal as having significant negative budgetary implications.

### Congressional Budget Office

The Congressional Budget Office has analyzed Social Security benefit taxation in their Budget Options series and other publications {cite}`cbo2023`.

### Joint Committee on Taxation

The JCT has examined the revenue implications of Social Security benefit taxation reforms {cite}`jct2022revenue`.

## Full Taxation of Social Security Benefits

Organizations have also analyzed proposals to tax Social Security benefits like other income sources, either by eliminating thresholds or taxing 100% of benefits. While specific estimates vary, analyses from CBO {cite}`cbo2023`, JCT {cite}`jct2023ss`, and other organizations generally find that expanding taxation would generate significant additional revenue, though less than might be expected due to the current tax treatment already affecting higher-income beneficiaries.

## Comparison of Organizational Estimates

The variation in estimates across organizations reflects different methodological approaches, data sources, and modeling assumptions. Key differences include:

- **Data Sources**: Organizations use different underlying datasets (CPS, IRS tax data, or combinations)
- **Behavioral Responses**: Static vs. dynamic scoring approaches
- **Time Horizons**: Different projection periods
- **Interaction Effects**: Varying treatment of state taxes and other provisions

## Implications for Current Analysis

The prior research provides important context for our analysis:

- **Baseline Differences**: The One Big Beautiful Bill's temporary senior deduction (2025-2028) was not included in these prior estimates, affecting baseline comparisons
- **Methodological Alignment**: Our use of PolicyEngine's microsimulation model follows similar approaches to CBO and JCT
- **Trust Fund Impacts**: CRFB's analysis highlights the significant effects on Social Security and Medicare trust fund solvency

These external estimates serve as useful reference points, though direct comparisons must account for differences in baseline assumptions, particularly the new senior deduction provisions enacted after these analyses were completed.
