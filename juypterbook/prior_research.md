# Prior Research and Analysis

This chapter examines how major analytical organizations have estimated the budgetary impacts of Social Security benefit taxation reforms, with particular focus on full repeal and full taxation options. We present specific estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), and Tax Foundation to provide context for our analysis.

## Full Repeal of Social Security Benefit Taxation (Option 1)

Several organizations have analyzed the budgetary impact of completely eliminating the taxation of Social Security benefits. These estimates vary based on methodology, data sources, and projection periods.

**Important Note:** These estimates were produced before the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which includes a temporary \$6,000 bonus senior deduction (2025-2028). This new deduction reduces the baseline revenue from Social Security benefit taxation, which affects the cost estimates of full repeal.

### Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget Analysis (July 2024)

CRFB analyzed the proposal to end taxation of Social Security benefits, emphasizing the impact on Social Security trust fund solvency {cite}`crfb2024trump`.

| Analysis Component | Impact |
|-------------------|---------|
| 10-Year Revenue Loss (2025-2034) | \$1.6-1.8 trillion |
| Social Security 75-Year Shortfall Increase | 25% (0.9% of payroll) |
| Medicare 75-Year Shortfall Increase | Nearly triples (0.6% of payroll) |
| Social Security Trust Fund Insolvency | Moved from late 2033 to early 2032 |
| Medicare Trust Fund Insolvency | Moved from 2036 to 2030 (6 years earlier) |

**CRFB Methodology Notes:**
- Based on CBO and Social Security Trustees estimates
- Includes both direct revenue loss and trust fund impacts
- Accounts for interaction with Medicare taxes
- Static analysis without behavioral responses
- Estimate produced before One Big Beautiful Bill provisions enacted

### Tax Foundation Analysis (August 2024)

The Tax Foundation provided commentary on Trump's suggestion to end the taxation of Social Security benefits, characterizing it as "unsound and fiscally irresponsible" {cite}`taxfoundation2024trump`.

**Key Points from Tax Foundation:**
- Criticized the proposal from a fiscal policy perspective
- Noted significant budgetary implications
- Emphasized the proposal would worsen federal deficits
- Analysis conducted before One Big Beautiful Bill provisions

### Congressional Budget Office

The Congressional Budget Office has analyzed Social Security benefit taxation in their Budget Options series and other publications {cite}`cbo2023`.

### Joint Committee on Taxation

The JCT has examined the revenue implications of Social Security benefit taxation reforms {cite}`jct2022revenue`.

## Full Taxation of Social Security Benefits

Organizations have also analyzed proposals to tax Social Security benefits like other income sources, either by eliminating thresholds or taxing 100% of benefits. While specific estimates vary, analyses from CBO {cite}`cbo2023`, JCT {cite}`jct2023ss`, and other organizations generally find that expanding taxation would generate significant additional revenue, though less than might be expected due to the current tax treatment already affecting higher-income beneficiaries.

## Comparison of Organizational Estimates

The variation in estimates across organizations reflects different methodological approaches, data sources, and modeling assumptions. Key differences include:

- **Data Sources**: Organizations use different underlying datasets (CPS, IRS tax data, or combinations)
- **Behavioral Responses**: Static vs. dynamic scoring approaches
- **Time Horizons**: Different projection periods
- **Interaction Effects**: Varying treatment of state taxes and other provisions

## Implications for Current Analysis

The prior research provides important context for our analysis:

- **Baseline Differences**: The One Big Beautiful Bill's temporary senior deduction (2025-2028) was not included in these prior estimates, affecting baseline comparisons
- **Methodological Alignment**: Our use of PolicyEngine's microsimulation model follows similar approaches to CBO and JCT
- **Trust Fund Impacts**: CRFB's analysis highlights the significant effects on Social Security and Medicare trust fund solvency

These external estimates serve as useful reference points, though direct comparisons must account for differences in baseline assumptions, particularly the new senior deduction provisions enacted after these analyses were completed.
