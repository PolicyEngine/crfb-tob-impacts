    "# Household Impact Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter analyzes how each of the seven Social Security taxation reform options affects individual households across different income levels. The analysis shows both the change in net income and comparative baseline vs. reform scenarios for each policy option.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Household Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The household impact analysis uses a representative household with the following characteristics:\n",
    "- Single elderly tax filer\n",
    "- Age 70\n",
    "- Social Security benefits: $30,000 per year\n",
    "- Employment income varying from $0 to $200,000 in $500 increments\n",
    "- Located in Florida (no state income tax)\n",
    "- Standard deduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For each income level and policy option, we calculate:\n",
    "1. **Change in Net Income**: The difference in household net income under the reform versus baseline\n",
    "2. **Baseline vs Reform Comparison**: Total net income under current law versus under each policy reform"
