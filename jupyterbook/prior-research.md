# Prior Research and Analysis

This chapter examines how major analytical organizations have estimated the budgetary impacts of Social Security benefit taxation reforms, with particular focus on full repeal and full taxation options. We present specific estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), and Tax Foundation to provide context for our analysis.

## Full Repeal of Social Security Benefit Taxation (Option 1)

Several organizations have analyzed the budgetary impact of completely eliminating the taxation of Social Security benefits. These estimates vary based on methodology, data sources, and projection periods.

**Important Note:** These estimates were produced before the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which, amoung several individual income tax provisions, includes a temporary \$6,000 bonus senior deduction (2025-2028). This new deduction reduces the baseline revenue from Social Security benefit taxation, which affects the cost estimates of full repeal.

### Revenue Loss Estimates for Full Repeal

The following table compares 10-year revenue loss estimates (2025-2034) from major analytical organizations for completely eliminating Social Security benefit taxation:

| Organization | Estimate Type | 10-Year Revenue Loss (2025-2034) | Source |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| Congressional Budget Office | Conventional | \$1.6 trillion | {cite}`cbo2024options` |
| Social Security Trustees | Conventional | \$1.8 trillion | {cite}`ssa2024trustees` |
| Tax Foundation | Conventional | \$1.4 trillion | {cite}`taxfoundation2024trump` |
| Tax Foundation | Dynamic | \$1.3 trillion | {cite}`taxfoundation2024trump` |

The Congressional Budget Office regularly provides estimates for changes to Social Security benefit taxation as part of their Options for Reducing the Deficit series. The Social Security Board of Trustees provides detailed projections of the impact of benefit taxation on trust fund solvency in their annual report. The Tax Foundation analyzed Trump's proposal to eliminate Social Security benefit taxation using their Taxes and Growth model, noting that their estimate uses Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts for taxable Social Security benefits, which may differ from the assumptions used by the Social Security trustees.

## Bonus Senior Deduction

### Joint Committee on Taxation Estimates (2025)

The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated the revenue impact of the bonus senior deduction included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act {cite}`jct2025bonus`.

| Provision | Fiscal Impact |
|----------|---------------|
| Bonus Senior Deduction (FY 2025-2034) | -\$66.3 billion |

The JCT projects that the \$6,000 bonus senior deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older will reduce federal revenues by \$66.3 billion over the ten fiscal years from 2025 through 2034. This deduction is scheduled to expire at the end of 2028 under current law, with the revenue loss concentrated in the years 2025-2028 when the deduction is in effect.

## Implications for Current Analysis

The prior research provides important context for our analysis:

- **Baseline Differences**: The One Big Beautiful Bill's temporary senior deduction (2025-2028) was not included in these prior estimates, affecting baseline comparisons
- **Methodological Alignment**: Our use of PolicyEngine's microsimulation model follows similar approaches to CBO and JCT
- **Trust Fund Impacts**: CRFB's analysis highlights the significant effects on Social Security and Medicare trust fund solvency

These external estimates serve as useful reference points, though direct comparisons must account for differences in baseline assumptions, particularly the new senior deduction provisions enacted after these analyses were completed.
