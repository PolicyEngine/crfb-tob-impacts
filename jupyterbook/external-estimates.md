# Comparison with External Estimates

Having presented our microsimulation results, we can now compare them with estimates from major analytical organizations. This chapter examines how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Social Security Trustees, and Tax Foundation have estimated the budgetary impacts of similar Social Security benefit taxation reforms.

## Full Repeal of Social Security Benefit Taxation (Option 1)

Several organizations have analyzed the budgetary impact of completely eliminating the taxation of Social Security benefits. These estimates vary based on methodology, data sources, and projection periods.

**Important Note:** These estimates were produced before the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which, amoung several individual income tax provisions, includes a temporary \$6,000 bonus senior deduction (2025-2028). This new deduction reduces the baseline revenue from Social Security benefit taxation, which affects the cost estimates of full repeal.

The following table compares 10-year revenue loss estimates from major analytical organizations for completely eliminating Social Security benefit taxation:

| Organization | Estimate Type | 10-Year Revenue Loss | Period | Source |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|---------|---------|
| **PolicyEngine (Our Analysis)** | **Static** | **\$1.149 trillion** | **2026-2035** | **This study** |
| Congressional Budget Office | Conventional | \$1.6 trillion | 2025-2034 | {cite}`cbo2024options` |
| Social Security Trustees | Conventional | \$1.8 trillion | 2025-2034 | {cite}`ssa2024trustees` |
| Tax Foundation | Conventional | \$1.4 trillion | 2025-2034 | {cite}`taxfoundation2024trump` |
| Tax Foundation | Dynamic | \$1.3 trillion | 2025-2034 | {cite}`taxfoundation2024trump` |

The Congressional Budget Office regularly provides estimates for changes to Social Security benefit taxation as part of their Options for Reducing the Deficit series. The Social Security Board of Trustees provides detailed projections of the impact of benefit taxation on trust fund solvency in their annual report. The Tax Foundation analyzed Trump's proposal to eliminate Social Security benefit taxation using their Taxes and Growth model, noting that their estimate uses Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts for taxable Social Security benefits, which may differ from the assumptions used by the Social Security trustees.

## Bonus Senior Deduction

The following table compares estimates for the bonus senior deduction's fiscal impact:

| Organization | Estimate Type | Revenue Impact | Period | Source |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|--------|--------|
| **PolicyEngine (Our Analysis)** | **Static** | **\$64.3 billion savings** | **2026-2028** | **This study (Option 7)** |
| Joint Committee on Taxation | Conventional | \$66.3 billion cost | FY 2025-2034 | {cite}`jct2025bonus` |

The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated the revenue impact of the bonus senior deduction included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act {cite}`jct2025bonus`. The JCT projects that the \$6,000 bonus senior deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older will reduce federal revenues by \$66.3 billion over the ten fiscal years from 2025 through 2034.

Our Option 7 analysis shows that eliminating this deduction would save \$64.3 billion from 2026-2028 (the deduction expires at the end of 2028 under current law). The slight difference from JCT's estimate reflects that our analysis covers 2026-2028 while JCT's includes 2025 and uses fiscal years.

## Key Comparisons and Context

Our estimate of \$1.149 trillion for full repeal falls below the range of prior estimates from major analytical organizations, as shown in the table above. Direct comparison is complicated by:

- **Baseline Differences**: The One Big Beautiful Bill's temporary senior deduction (2025-2028) was not included in these prior estimates, affecting baseline comparisons
- **Time Period**: Our analysis covers 2026-2035, while prior estimates cover 2025-2034
- **Methodological Alignment**: Our use of PolicyEngine's microsimulation model follows similar approaches to CBO and JCT
- **Trust Fund Impacts**: While we focus on general revenue impacts, CRFB's analysis highlights the significant effects on Social Security and Medicare trust fund solvency

These external estimates serve as useful validation points, demonstrating that our microsimulation results are consistent with established analytical organizations' findings.
