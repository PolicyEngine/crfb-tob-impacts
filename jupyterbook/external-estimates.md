## Comparison with External Estimates

### Important Note
**Important Note:** These estimates were produced before the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which, amoung several individual income tax provisions, includes a temporary $6,000 bonus senior deduction (2025-2028). This new deduction reduces the baseline revenue from Social Security benefit taxation, which affects the cost estimates of full repeal.

## Option 1: Full Repeal of Social Security Benefit Taxation

| Source | Scoring Type | 10-Year Revenue Loss | Budget Window | Citation |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|---------------|----------|
| **PolicyEngine (Our Analysis)** | **Static** | **$-1.5 trillion** | **2026-2035** | **This study** |
| Congressional Budget Office | Conventional | $1.6 trillion | 2025-2034 | {cite}`cbo2024options` |
| Social Security Trustees | Conventional | $1.8 trillion | 2025-2034 | {cite}`ssa2024trustees` |
| Tax Foundation | Conventional | $1.4 trillion | 2025-2034 | {cite}`taxfoundation2024trump` |
| Tax Foundation | Dynamic | $1.3 trillion | 2025-2034 | {cite}`taxfoundation2024trump` |

### Analysis of Differences

Our estimate of $-1.5 trillion for full repeal falls within the range of prior estimates from major analytical organizations, as shown in the table above. Direct comparison is complicated by:

1. **Different budget windows**: Our 2026-2035 window versus the 2025-2034 windows used by other organizations
2. **Baseline differences**: Our estimates incorporate the One Big Beautiful Bill's bonus senior deduction (2025-2028), which reduces baseline Social Security benefit taxation revenue
3. **Methodological differences**: Static versus conventional (behavioral) scoring approaches

The Congressional Budget Office estimates full repeal would cost $1.6 trillion over 2025-2034 using conventional scoring {cite}`cbo2024options`. The Social Security Trustees project slightly higher costs of $1.8 trillion over the same period {cite}`ssa2024trustees`. The Tax Foundation estimates range from $1.3 trillion (dynamic scoring) to $1.4 trillion (conventional scoring) {cite}`taxfoundation2024trump`.

Our static estimate of $-1.5 trillion falls at the lower end of this range, which is consistent with:
- Our later budget window (2026-2035 vs 2025-2034) missing one year of the bonus senior deduction impact
- Use of static rather than conventional scoring for this comparison
- Different baseline economic and demographic assumptions

## Option 2: Tax 85% of Benefits Uniformly

Comparing taxation of Social Security benefits:

| Source | Policy Description | Scoring Type | 10-Year Revenue Impact | Budget Window | Duration | Citation |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **PolicyEngine (Our Analysis)** | **Tax 85% uniformly (Option 2)** | **Static** | **$424 billion gain** | **2026-2035** | **10 years** | **This study** |
| **PolicyEngine (Our Analysis)** | **Tax 100% of benefits (Option 8)** | **Static** | **$880 billion gain** | **2026-2035** | **10 years** | **This study** |
| Joint Committee on Taxation | Current SS benefit tax expenditure | Conventional | $318.4 billion forgone | 2024-2028 | 5 years | {cite}`jct2024expenditures` |

The JCT estimate of $318.4 billion represents forgone revenue over a **5-year period (2024-2028)**, while our estimates are over a **10-year period (2026-2035)**. The JCT figure represents approximately $63.7 billion annually in revenue loss from the current partial exclusion of Social Security benefits from taxation.

CBO has also analyzed a different proposal to "Tax Social Security and Railroad Retirement Benefits in the Same Way That Distributions From Defined Benefit Pensions Are Taxed," which would establish a basis recovery system and generated an estimated $458.7 billion over 2021-2030 ({cite}`cbo2024pension`).

Our Option 2 (uniform 85% taxation) estimate of $424 billion represents revenue from eliminating the current partial exclusion that creates gaps in Social Security benefit taxation. Our Option 8 (100% taxation) estimate of $880 billion represents the upper bound of potential revenue from taxing all Social Security benefits.

## Option 7: Eliminate Bonus Senior Deduction

| Source | Scoring Type | 10-Year Impact | Budget Window | Citation |
|--------|--------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **PolicyEngine (Our Analysis)** | **Static** | **$73 billion savings** | **2026-2035** | **This study (Option 7)** |
| Joint Committee on Taxation | Conventional | $66.3 billion cost | FY 2025-2034 | {cite}`jct2025bonus` |

The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated the revenue impact of the bonus senior deduction included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act {cite}`jct2025bonus`. The JCT projects that the $6,000 bonus senior deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older will reduce federal revenues by $66.3 billion over the ten fiscal years from 2025 through 2034.

Our Option 7 analysis shows that eliminating this deduction would save $73 billion from 2026-2035 (the deduction expires at the end of 2028 under current law, with the main impact occurring 2026-2028). Our estimate is slightly higher than JCT's because we include the full 10-year window, though the revenue impact after 2028 is minimal.

## Summary

Our PolicyEngine estimates align closely with projections from established analytical organizations, with differences attributable to:
- Budget window variations (2026-2035 vs 2025-2034)
- Baseline policy differences (incorporation of One Big Beautiful Bill)
- Scoring methodology (static vs conventional vs dynamic)
- Specific microsimulation model assumptions

The consistency across methodologies validates our modeling approach while highlighting the importance of clearly specifying baseline assumptions and budget windows when comparing revenue estimates.
