# Comparison with External Estimates

Having presented our microsimulation results, we can now compare them with estimates from major analytical organizations. This chapter examines how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), Social Security Trustees, and Tax Foundation have estimated the budgetary impacts of similar Social Security benefit taxation reforms.

## Full Repeal of Social Security Benefit Taxation (Option 1)

Several organizations have analyzed the budgetary impact of completely eliminating the taxation of Social Security benefits. These estimates vary based on methodology, data sources, and projection periods.

**Important Note:** These estimates were produced before the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which, amoung several individual income tax provisions, includes a temporary \$6,000 bonus senior deduction (2025-2028). This new deduction reduces the baseline revenue from Social Security benefit taxation, which affects the cost estimates of full repeal.

The following table compares 10-year revenue loss estimates from major analytical organizations for completely eliminating Social Security benefit taxation:

| Organization | Estimate Type | 10-Year Revenue Loss | Period | Source |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|---------|---------|
| **PolicyEngine (Our Analysis)** | **Static** | **\$1.149 trillion** | **2026-2035** | **This study** |
| Congressional Budget Office | Conventional | \$1.6 trillion | 2025-2034 | {cite}`cbo2024options` |
| Social Security Trustees | Conventional | \$1.8 trillion | 2025-2034 | {cite}`ssa2024trustees` |
| Tax Foundation | Conventional | \$1.4 trillion | 2025-2034 | {cite}`taxfoundation2024trump` |
| Tax Foundation | Dynamic | \$1.3 trillion | 2025-2034 | {cite}`taxfoundation2024trump` |

The Congressional Budget Office regularly provides estimates for changes to Social Security benefit taxation as part of their Options for Reducing the Deficit series. The Social Security Board of Trustees provides detailed projections of the impact of benefit taxation on trust fund solvency in their annual report. The Tax Foundation analyzed Trump's proposal to eliminate Social Security benefit taxation using their Taxes and Growth model, noting that their estimate uses Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts for taxable Social Security benefits, which may differ from the assumptions used by the Social Security trustees.

## Taxation of 85% of Social Security Benefits (Option 2)

CBO has analyzed a proposal to "Tax Social Security and Railroad Retirement Benefits in the Same Way That Distributions From Defined Benefit Pensions Are Taxed." This would eliminate income thresholds and tax a uniform 85% of benefits for all recipients:

| Organization | Estimate Type | 10-Year Revenue Gain | Period | Source |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|---------|--------|
| **PolicyEngine (Our Analysis)** | **Static** | **\$227.5 billion** | **2026-2035** | **This study** |
| Congressional Budget Office | Conventional | \$458.7 billion | 2021-2030 | {cite}`cbo2024pension` |
| Joint Committee on Taxation | Tax Expenditure | \$506 billion | 2024-2033 | JCX-48-24 (annual ~\$50.6B) |

### Analysis of Differences

Our estimate of \$227.5 billion is lower than CBO's \$458.7 billion estimate. Several factors may explain this difference:

1. **Time Period Differences**: CBO's estimate covers 2021-2030 while ours covers 2026-2035, representing different economic baselines and Social Security benefit levels.

2. **Baseline Differences**: The One Big Beautiful Bill's temporary \$6,000 bonus senior deduction (2025-2028) reduces the baseline revenue from Social Security benefit taxation during the overlapping years. This deduction was not included in CBO's 2021 analysis.

3. **Reform Specification**: Both proposals eliminate income thresholds and tax 85% of Social Security benefits uniformly for all recipients. The CBO title references treating Social Security "like a private pension" in terms of removing income thresholds, though private pensions are typically fully taxable (minus any basis).

4. **Interaction Effects**: The presence of the bonus senior deduction creates interaction effects that reduce the revenue gain from taxing 85% of benefits, particularly in years 2026-2028 when both provisions overlap.

5. **Economic Assumptions**: Different projections for inflation, wage growth, and Social Security benefit levels between the 2021-2030 and 2026-2035 periods affect revenue estimates.

These differences highlight the importance of clearly specifying reform parameters and baseline assumptions when comparing estimates across organizations.

## Bonus Senior Deduction

The following table compares estimates for the bonus senior deduction's fiscal impact:

| Organization | Estimate Type | Revenue Impact | Period | Source |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|--------|--------|
| **PolicyEngine (Our Analysis)** | **Static** | **\$64.3 billion savings** | **2026-2028** | **This study (Option 7)** |
| Joint Committee on Taxation | Conventional | \$66.3 billion cost | FY 2025-2034 | {cite}`jct2025bonus` |

The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated the revenue impact of the bonus senior deduction included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act {cite}`jct2025bonus`. The JCT projects that the \$6,000 bonus senior deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older will reduce federal revenues by \$66.3 billion over the ten fiscal years from 2025 through 2034.

Our Option 7 analysis shows that eliminating this deduction would save \$64.3 billion from 2026-2028 (the deduction expires at the end of 2028 under current law). The slight difference from JCT's estimate reflects that our analysis covers 2026-2028 while JCT's includes 2025 and uses fiscal years.

## Key Comparisons and Context

Our estimate of \$1.149 trillion for full repeal falls below the range of prior estimates from major analytical organizations, as shown in the table above. Direct comparison is complicated by:

- **Baseline Differences**: The One Big Beautiful Bill's temporary senior deduction (2025-2028) was not included in these prior estimates, affecting baseline comparisons
- **Time Period**: Our analysis covers 2026-2035, while prior estimates cover 2025-2034
- **Methodological Alignment**: Our use of PolicyEngine's microsimulation model follows similar approaches to CBO and JCT
- **Trust Fund Impacts**: While we focus on general revenue impacts, CRFB's analysis highlights the significant effects on Social Security and Medicare trust fund solvency

These external estimates serve as useful validation points. While our estimates for some reforms (like full repeal) align closely with other organizations, differences in other areas (like the 85% taxation option) highlight the importance of understanding baseline assumptions and reform specifications when comparing analyses.
